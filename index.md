#ABSTRACT
This was our first ever satellite-related project. It was meant to be a model of a satellite launched to a low altitude with Helium balloon. Everything was built from scratch. The Model satellite consists of a camera payload (whose orientation is controllable from Ground Station using a joystick), Inertial Measurement Unit, Temperature Sensor, Pressure Sensor and SD Card.
