{"name":"Low Altitude Balloon Satellite","tagline":"Edward Elson | Edwin Ferbianto | Soon Renhao | Zhang Huichen","body":"#ABSTRACT\r\nThis was our first ever satellite-related project. It was meant to be a model of a satellite launched to a low altitude with Helium balloon. Everything was built from scratch. The Model satellite consists of a camera payload (whose orientation is controllable from Ground Station using a joystick), Inertial Measurement Unit, Temperature Sensor, Pressure Sensor and SD Card.  \r\n\r\n![Cube 1](https://googledrive.com/host/0B3qXE5D5r-qCYzhBUF81cFN6Wlk/IMG-20140411-WA0008.jpg)   \r\n_Our Team with the model satellite and ground station_  \r\n![Cube 2](https://googledrive.com/host/0B3qXE5D5r-qCYzhBUF81cFN6Wlk/20140402_205746.jpg)   \r\n![Cube 3](https://googledrive.com/host/0B3qXE5D5r-qCYzhBUF81cFN6Wlk/20140325_191045.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThe model satellite and ground station was powered by an Arduino MEGA based driver board.
